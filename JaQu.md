# What is JaQu #

JaQu stands for Java Query and allows to access databases using pure Java. JaQu provides a fluent interface (or internal DSL) for building SQL statements. JaQu replaces SQL, JDBC, and persistence frameworks such as Hibernate. JaQu is something like LINQ for Java (LINQ stands for "language integrated query" and is a Microsoft .NET technology).
